\description{
We conveniently package map datasets for the world
(taken from Eurostat/GISCO) that can be used in ggplot2 without needing any geo
libraries. This data is licensed under specific conditions noted in the details section.
}
\details{
This world map contains 254 administrative regions (`iso3_eurostat`), as defined by Eurostat/GISCO.
The Vatican is not included in these administrative regions.
Antarctica was physically removed by the maintainers of this R package.

A second variable (`iso3_un195`) maps these administrative regions to:
\itemize{
  \item 193 UN member states
  \item 1 non-member permanent observer state (State of Palestine)
  \item "DISPUTED" (Western Sahara, Paracel Islands, Askai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh,
China/India, Hala'Ib Triangle, Ilemi Triangle, Jammu Kashmir, Kuril Islands,
Navassa Island, Scarborough Reef, Senkaku Islands, Bassa Da India, Abyei,
Bir Tawil)
}

\itemize{
\item The data will not be used for commercial purposes
\item The source will be acknowledged. A copyright notice will have to be visible on any printed or electronic publication using this dataset
