\description{
This dataset is used to transfer municipality level datasets (that have already
been redistricted) to future borders. If `border_start=2018` then it is
assumed that the 2018 borders were used from 2000-2018, and then 2019 borders
used for 2019, 2020 borders for 2020, and so on. Hence a combination of `year`
and `border_start` must always be used.
